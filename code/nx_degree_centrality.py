def degree_centrality(G):
    """Compute the degree centrality for nodes.

    The degree centrality for a node v is the fraction of nodes it
    is connected to.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : graph
      A Networkx graph

    Returns
    -------
    nodes : dictionary
       Dictionary of nodes with degree centrality as the value.

    See Also
    --------
    betweenness_centrality, load_centrality, eigenvector_centrality

    Notes
    -----
    The degree centrality values are normalized by dividing by the maximum 
    possible degree in a simple graph n-1 where n is the number of nodes in G.

    For multigraphs or graphs with self loops the maximum degree might
    be higher than n-1 and values of degree centrality greater than 1
    are possible.
